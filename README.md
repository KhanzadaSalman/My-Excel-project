# My-Excel-project

• Purpose: To transform complex sales data into clear visualizations and perform in-depth analysis using Excel.
• Problem: The available sales data lacked clear visual representation and required analysis to identify trends and patterns.
• Solution: Created an Excel-based dashboard to:
o	Present sales trends using interactive charts.
o	Analyze sales by customer demographics (e.g., gender, age).
o	Visualize order status distribution.
o	Determine sales performance by different channels.
